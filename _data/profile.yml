  <p>
  I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Math at Washington University in St.Louis (not in Seattle or DC...). My academic interests are in the intersection of algebraic geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.
  </p>
  <p>
   My current project involves studying the irreducibility condition for some indecomposable Hessenberg Varieties through both Lie theoretical and computational methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    My academic advisor is <a href="https://www.math.wustl.edu/~precup/" target="_blank">Martha Precup</a>.
